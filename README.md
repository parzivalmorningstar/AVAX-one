1. SPDX-License-Identifier and pragma:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT: This comment specifies the license under which the code is distributed, in this case, the MIT License.
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;: This line tells the Solidity compiler which version of the language the code is written for and allows for future compatible upgrades (up to but not including version 0.9.0).
2. Contract Definition:

contract myToken {: This declares a new smart contract named myToken. Contracts are self-contained applications deployed on the blockchain that can hold data and execute code.
3. Constructor:

constructor() { ... }: This function is called automatically when a new instance of the contract is created (deployed). It sets the owner variable to the address of the person who deployed the contract.
4. Public Variables:

string public name = "Metacrafters";: This variable stores the name of the token, which is "Metacrafters" in this case.
string public symbol = "MTAC";: This variable holds the token's symbol, which is "MTAC" here.
uint public totalSupply = 0;: This variable keeps track of the total amount of tokens in circulation, initially set to 0.
address public owner;: This variable stores the address of the contract's owner (set in the constructor).
5. Events:

event Mint(address indexed to, uint amount);: This event is emitted whenever new tokens are minted (created). It includes the address that receives the tokens (to) and the amount minted (amount).
event Burn(address indexed from, uint amount);: This event is emitted when tokens are burned (destroyed). It includes the address from which the tokens are burned (from) and the amount burned (amount).
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount);: This event is emitted whenever tokens are transferred between accounts. It includes the address sending the tokens (from), the address receiving the tokens (to), and the amount transferred (amount).
6. Custom Error:

error InsufficientBalance(uint balance, uint withdrawAmount);: This defines a custom error type called InsufficientBalance that can be used to revert transactions if an account tries to burn or transfer more tokens than it has. The error includes information about the account's balance (balance) and the attempted withdrawal amount (withdrawAmount).
7. Mapping:

mapping(address => uint) public balances;: This creates a mapping that associates each address (account) with its token balance. Mappings are like key-value stores where the address is the key and the balance is the value.
8. Modifier:

modifier onlyOwner { ... }: This modifier restricts certain functions to be called only by the contract's owner (the address stored in owner). The _ symbol within the modifier represents the function that will be executed with the onlyOwner restriction.
9. Mint Function:

function mint (address _address, uint _value) public onlyOwner { ... }: This function allows the contract's owner to mint (create) new tokens for a specified address (_address) and amount (_value). It increases the totalSupply and the balance of the recipient address. Additionally, it emits a Mint event.
10. Burn Function:

function burn (address _address, uint _value) public onlyOwner { ... }: This function enables the owner to burn (destroy) tokens from a specific address (_address) and amount (_value). It checks if the account has sufficient balance using the require statement. If not, it reverts the transaction with the custom InsufficientBalance error. If the balance is sufficient, it reduces the totalSupply and the balance of the burning address. It also emits a Burn event.
11. Transfer Function:

function transfer(address _receiver, uint _value) public { ... }: This function allows anyone to transfer tokens from their account (the sender's address) to another address (_receiver) for a specified amount (_value). It checks if the sender has enough tokens using the require statement. If not, it reverts the transaction with an error message. If the sender has enough tokens, it reduces the sender's balance and increases the receiver's balance. Finally, it emits a Transfer event.
In summary, this Solidity code defines a basic ERC-20-like token that can be minted, burned, and transferred between accounts. The contract keeps track of the total supply,
